This website is essentially a place where I can
  - Sketch out the technical details of things that I like, for the purpose of remembering and organizing my thoughts
  - Give (potentially bad) takes on a variety of subjects: Math, Statistics, Computer Science, Gaming, Books, etc.
  - Provide updates of things that I may be currently working on.

This is all sort of de*pending* on how much I utilize the blog. It's probably helpful to think of this website as a giant work-in-progress. Pages may change over time, opinions may change over time, technical interests and know-how may change over time. I like lists, so here are some:

### Technical interests:
  - The probabilistic method in combinatorics
  - (Bayesian) statistics and machine learning, begrudgingly
  - Graph Theory, both applied and theoretical. For example, I like social networks and Bayesian networks as models, but I would prefer thinking about Ramsey numbers

### Non-technical interests:
  - Recently I became a huge fan of the Monster Hunter series, putting in 500 hours into Monster Hunter World during COVID-19 quarantine
  - Anime (unfortunately)
  - Bouldering. Current skill: VB-V0. Personal Record: V4
  - Olympic Weightlifting and Powerlifting. I don't lift any more, but here are some old (unofficial) personal records since I am proud of them:
    * Snatch: 92kg, Clean&Jerk: 127kg @ 80kg weight class
    * Squat: 460lbs, Bench Press: 280lbs, Deadlift: 500lbs @ 203lb bodyweight.


### Currently working on:
  - Making this blog presentable
  - Learning Haskell
  - Learning "infinitary combinatorics"
  - Applying to PhDs in Math and Computer Science
  - Getting back into gaming because I am working on...
  - Not getting COVID-19

### Stuff I want to work on:
  - Getting back into a gym to climb rocks and/or lift weights
  - Combinatorics (of a probabilistic flavor)
  - Math Book Reviews
  - Video Game Reviews
  - Getting a solid 8 hours of sleep a night
  - Figuring out how to track viewer statistics on this site
