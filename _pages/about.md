I am a PhD student at University of California, Santa Cruz. My adviser is Lindsey Kuper.
I work on a fascinating intersection of distributed systems theory and programming languages theory.
My primary work has centered around the use of (bi)simulation relations in order to establish equivalences
in realistic models of distributed systems, lately centering around conflict-free replicated data types,
and often borrowing concepts and tools from programming language theory to achieve this.
 
### Research Interests:
  - programming languages, type theory
  - theory of distributed systems, conflict-free replicated data types
  - coalgebra semantics, process calculi, bisimulation
  - formal verification, interactive theorem provers
  

### Non-technical interests
  - i like to play video games, and i am partial to the following series: final fantasy, dragon quest, monster hunter, soulsborne, baldur's gate 3
  - my most played game is Final Fantasy XIV. i raid high-end content and i main the tank role, with Warrior and Dark Knight being my main jobs.
    During the Abyssos savage raid tier, I held rank 5 in the world among all Warrior players for recorded DPS
    in P6S (the Hegemone fight).
  - for table top games, i enjoy DnD and i paint warhammer 40000 figures (Astra Militarum!)
  - Other interests:
    * anime, ww2 era warships and tanks
    * olympic weightlifting and powerlifting. i don't lift any more (last competition was in 2016) but here are some old
      personal records: snatch 92kg, clean and jerk: 127kg (@ 80kg weight class), 
      squat 460lbs, bench press 280lbs, deadlift 500lbs (@ 203lb weightclass)
