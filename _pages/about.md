This website is essentially a place where I can
  - Sketch out the technical details of things that I like, for the purpose of remembering and organizing my thoughts
  - Give (potentially bad) takes on a variety of subjects: Math, Statistics, Computer Science, Gaming, Books, etc.
  - Provide updates of things that I may be currently working on.

This is all sort of de*pending* on how much I utilize the blog. It's probably helpful to think of this website as a giant work-in-progress. Pages may change over time, opinions may change over time, technical interests and know-how may change over time. I like lists, so here are some:



Currently working on:
  - Making this blog presentable
  - Learning Haskell
  - Learning "infinitary combinatorics"
  - Applying to PhDs in Math and Computer Science
  - Getting back into gaming because I am working on...
  - Not getting COVID

Stuff I want to work on:
  - Getting back into a gym to climb rocks and/or lift weights
  - Combinatorics (of a probabilistic flavor)
  - Math Book Reviews
  - Video Game Reviews
  - Getting a solid 8 hours of sleep a night
  - Figuring out how to track viewer statistics on this site
