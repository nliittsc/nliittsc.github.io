Education
======
* B.S. Applied Mathematics from UC San Diego
  - Graduated with "Honors with Distinction"
  - I wrote an undergraduate thesis where I did some work on applied Causal Inference
  - I mostly studied Probability Theory and Statistics. I actually satisfied the requirements for both the "Applied Mathematics" and "Statistics and Probability" degrees. I opted for the former title since I figured it sounded better. 
* M.S. in Computer Science from UC San Diego (Spring 2021)
  - Currently on track to finish with a "Programming Languages" specialization
* P.h.D. in Computer Science from UC Santa Cruz (Pending)
  - Admitted for Fall 2021!
