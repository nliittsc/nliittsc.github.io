Why?

**I.**

This post has largely been inspired by the [following tweet](https://twitter.com/unormal/status/1319891914066481153?s=20): 

![Conspiracy?]({{site.url}}\images\gamingbad1.png)

I'll just flat out say it: It's definitely not a conspiracy. For those of you who aren't in the know, I'll summarize that the above tweet is referring to. Brian Bucklew is a game developer for [Caves of Qud](http://www.cavesofqud.com/) (CoQ), a "roguelike" game that is in "Early Access" on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). This essentially just means that players can buy and play an unfinished build of the game before its official release date. Anyway, the game has pretty good reviews and recently attracted attention since [this guy]() posted a [Youtube review of the game](). I haven't seen this Youtuber's channel before, but seeing as their most recent videos have 1M+ views, I guess they're pretty popular. During the video, the reviewer mentions that he got banned from CoQ's official Discord server (if you're not familiar, it's basically Slack for gamers) and I guess that was enough to make his fanbase go ballistic, start a bunch of sock-puppet accounts, and start brigading Brian's Twitter, CoQ game reviews on Steam, and the [/r/CavesofQud](https://www.reddit.com/r/cavesofqud/) subreddit. 

So, what exactly are they so riled up about? 

Basically, that they can't dominate the CoQ Discord the way they want to. They will *tell you* that it's because Brian is a dick who bans people for asking for a quest to play as the (racist) Templar (with a eugenics agenda) in CoQ, or that they're paying customers and this is about free speech, or that they're "just asking questions and trying to talk about the game", but as Brian points out in his Twitter thread, this is claim is simply a red herring. They're mad because Brian won't let them do what they've done to every single other gaming space: dominate it, control it, then turn it into a safe space for "ironic" racist memes. In other words, they want to turn yet another Discord channel into a nazi bar: [include image from twitter]

If you go onto spaces like Reddit, and ask "Why are so many young alt-righters also gamers?", the answer you will probably get is that the [alt-right is a counter culture](), that [gamers are alienated from society]() and thus naturally fall into extremist groups, or that [it's all gamergate's fault](), and so on. I think these explanations all have a bit of merit -- after all, human behaviour is really hard to pin down to a single "cause" -- but I think what these answers miss is the possibility *that there is something fundamentally baked into the philosophy of gaming itself.* What the previous answers implicitly assume is that there is nothing wrong with video games and *how they're made, marketed, and consumed*, there is only something wrong with *who consumes them*. [If you're playing a game, then that game is for you](). The consumption of media is not random. This is becoming somewhat more obvious with the advent of algorithmic news feeds and Youtube recommender systems (try watching a couple Joe Rogan clips on Youtube, then see what happens to your feed, ugh) but I think this point often still gets missed. Media is explicitly, intentionally designed to *feel* as if it was consumed incidentally. You're at your desk, trying to write a paper or something, open Twitter to take a break, and then suddenly 3 hours have gone by because you've been been watching Donald Trump and his supporters say stuff that is just positively, outrageously, insanely *wrong*. When you're finally fed up and close Twitter, it's time for dinner and you mentally kick yourself for having wasted so much precious time. Why are you even reading that stuff? You think Capitalism was a mistake, but somehow you keep "ending up" in these right wing spaces. It *feels* as if your encounter with those Twitter threads was incidental, but it wasn't. It was the algorithm and the human brain working as intended. It's called *doom scrolling* for a reason.

Think about this for a moment. Let's take the question and adjust it slightly. If you asked, "Why do so many racists own a copy of Mein Kampf?", most people would squint their eyes at you.  Why would racists want to read the *manifesto* of, like, the most racist guy? That's a joke, right? Maybe this is a ridiculous example, but what I want to get at here is not "Why do alt-righters enter gaming communities?" but "Why do alt-righters *play video games*?"

**III.**

Do video games push you towards fascist group-think? Even a little bit?

Before you start yelling, let me preface this by saying that I have spent an ungodly amount of time playing video games. I put $$\geq 500$$ hours into Monster Hunter World: Iceborne over the quarantine, played WAY too much (competitive) Pokemon as a kid, have gotten every ending in Dark Souls III (then racked up pale tongues in PvP), and could write you an essay for why Sorcerers are superior to Wizards in the Pathfinder rulesets. Okay? For all intents and purposes, I *am* a gamer. So, I'm not about to write some argument that maps to "video games are corrupting our youth", but what I do want to do is take a moment to analyze two observations about a popular genre of game: High Fantasy. The first observation, I will call *The Goblin Problem*, and the second observation I will call *The Paladin Problem*. I specifically have Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) in mind for this, but since DnD effectively has an isomorphism to all other fantasy games, I think it works well as a motivating example.

First, let's just introduce the two observations, then respond to some common criticism.

**IIIa. (The Goblin Problem):**
If you have ever played any kind of fantasy game that has knights, wizards, and non-human races (pretty much all of them), then your fantasy game will also have a basic enemy intended for the newbies and low level quests: goblins. The typical goblin enemy is small, green, with big point ears, a big nose and a love for getting the boys together and pillaging human(oid) settlements. A single goblin is usually fodder, practically irrelevant, but become dangerous when they attack en masse. The goblin is also *almost always inherently evil*. The only way to stop a goblin horde? Slay them all.

The interesting thing here is that goblins usually aren't depicted as mindless animals (and even if they were...). They are usually depicted as being able to communicate, work together towards a common goal, and live in tribes. They often wear armor and can use somewhat complicated weapons like a sword and shield, or a long-bow. Sometimes, the goblins even have spell-casters or shamans -- this means they can actually *learn* and *internalize* abstract concepts. In every single fantasy world, the use of magic and being able to use it boils down to (1) you understand that it is there, and (2) you can control it if you know "the secret". Maybe the secret is reading enough scrolls, or tapping into latent powers, or whatever, but either way, it requires processing and understanding some kind of abstraction. Do you see where I am going with this?

Goblins are *sentient*. They are aware of themselves, what they are doing, and even *why* they are doing it, but that last point is never shared to the player, it's never even discussed. Goblin bad. Goblin attck humans. Kill goblin. So far, this stuff is entirely consistent with the usual ingame world-building -- I haven't even tried to get political yet. The point here is that, even if it's not discussed, goblins are a fully self-aware race of beings and they are *always evil*. They are *always* a scourge that needs to be *wiped out*. There is no reasoning with goblins, there is no cooperating, or treaties, or debates, there is only slaying. 

This kind of world building is extremely common in fantasy games, and the insidious thing that is happening here is the subtext this kind of worldbuilding creates: *there are entire races of beings that have no value, or worth, whose only purpose is to stomped on by people who are stronger/better/gooder the moment they cause problems.* When playing these games, if it's not explicit, then it is implicitly demanded that the player simply accept this as a fact. You cannot reason with goblins, it is *simply impossible*. Sure, maybe some games allow you to attempt a dialogue as a mechanic that is baked directly into the quest, and sure, maybe there is a way to resolve that conflict peacefully, but the general trope remains the same. Even in games that distinctly try to be progressive and have good politics by including LGBTQ characters and difficult morally-grey dialogue choices *still* contain long story sequences in which you have to go and *genocide* a camp of goblins. Maybe the game let's you try to *not* genocide them, but if you fail a dialogue skill check, then welp. Better unsheathe your sword and tell your wizard to summon a fiery meteor, because they don't call DnD characters "murder-hobos" for no reason.

Let's summarize all this. *The Goblin Problem occurs when a race of sentient, intelligent, communication-capable beings are taken to be explicitly, or implicitly pure evil, and no serious (long term) options exist for dealing with them, other than war, oppression, or genocide.*

**IIIb. (The Paladin Problem):**

Whereas the Goblin Problem effectively maps to most games that involve some kind of "fantasy role playing" element, the Paladin Problem is a bit more specific to a certain class of games inspired by DnD. When people say "Paladin" in the context of video/tabletop gaming, they are usually referring to a warrior who wears heavy armor, typically uses swords/shields/hammers/whatever as their weapon and possesses some kind of "divine power". In DnD, a typical Paladin wears heavy armor, uses a sword & shield or a two-handed weapon like a warhammer, worships a deity and in return is blessed with divine spellcasting powers. They can cast spells that heal wounds, have numerous "anti-evil" spells that do extra damage to the undead or "evil" creatures (one spell in the Pathfinder paladin kit is literally called *Smite Evil*), and they must uphold the ideals of their deity. They are supposed to be a shining beacon of good and altruism.

Now for an aside: Dungeons and Dragons uses a thing called "alignment" to sort of map every character to a kind of 2D axis of morality. I won't get into the details, but basically you can be Chaotic, Neutral, or Lawful, which indicates how you feel about "order" as a general concept, and you can also be Evil, Neutral, or Good, which effectively measures your level of altruism. A Chaotic Evil character is basically a self-serving psychopath with no regard for society, libertarians *think* they're Neutral-Neutral characters for wanting the world to be "as nature intended", but actually they're Lawful Evil because of their unpenchant desire for authoritarianism and racial superiority. ("When governments no longer exist, I'll use my personal army of independent military contractors to take all your shit and burn your house down.")

Why explain this stuff about alignment? Because in order to be a paladin you *must*: (1) worship and please a divine deity, and (2) have the "Lawful Good" alignment. If you fail either of these things, you cannot be a Paladin. If you're an atheist, then no deity will give you divine powers. If you aren't Lawful Good, then you "fall" and lose your powers, becoming an ordinary warrior, and you will probably never get them back. "Paladins sound cool. I don't see the problem here." Well, let's take a closer look.
